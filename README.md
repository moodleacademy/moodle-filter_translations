This plugin is part of a set, which also includes [Moodle Atto Translations](https://github.com/andrewhancox/moodle-atto_translations)

Full documentation available at: https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Content_translation_plugin_set

# To Install it manually #
- Unzip the plugin in the moodle .../filter/translations directory.
- Also install the Atto plugin from: https://github.com/andrewhancox/moodle-atto_translations

# To Enable it #
- Go to "Site Administration &gt;&gt; Plugins &gt;&gt; Filters &gt;&gt; Manage filters" and enable the 'Content translations' plugin there.
- Go to "Site Administration &gt;&gt; Plugins &gt;&gt; Filters &gt;&gt; Content translations" and choose a caching level appropriate to your site.

# To Use it #
Users with the 'filter/translations:edittranslations' capability will see an icon in the top right hand corner of the screen to enable the translator view of the course. At this point all translatable text will have an icon injected next to it to allow it to be translated.

# To migrate from filter_fulltranslate #
A CLI tool is available to migrate all translations across from the filter_fulltranslate.

It is recommended that you clean out any unwanted translations that may have been generated as follows:
````
delete from mdl_filter_fulltranslate where sourcetext like '%{mlang%';
````

You can then copy the translations from filter_fulltranslate into filter_translations as follows:
````
php cli/migrate_filter_fulltranslate.php --confirm
````

# To add translation span tags to existing data #
A CLI tool is available to automatically add span tags to existing data. Please use with extreme caution.

You can run the tool as follows which will show help text:
````
php cli/insert_spans.php
````
